Coding Challenge for job interview



THIS PROJECT DOES REQUIRE NPM, NODEJS, REACT-BOOTSTRAP

Notes:
  1.) Mobile version is lacking an accordion because I was unsure of what elements you were referring to in the challenge that you wanted converted. I believe it is accessible enough in the state it is currently in. 
  2.) I did not bother looking for the fonts used in the original psd
  3.) project done with bootstrap, react, css/html5
  4.) used a handleClick method for the tab-swtiching because the base images I scrapped from the psd were not being friendly with the styling.
  5.) incredibly fun challenge! I learned a lot more about bootstrap in doing so. 

  Please do let me know what you think - I look forward to working with you Coalition Technologies.
